# StratusSwap

StratusSwap is a minimal decentralized exchange (DEX) prototype focused on direct ERC20-to-ERC20 token swaps. This repository provides the foundation for a gas-efficient and modular smart contract system that can be progressively expanded into a full-scale DEX.

## Overview

The initial version of StratusSwap implements a basic token swap mechanism between two ERC20 assets. The smart contracts are optimized for gas usage and written to be modular, allowing for straightforward upgrades such as liquidity pooling, slippage control, and multi-hop routing in later stages.

The project emphasizes clean architecture, secure interactions, and scalability, making it suitable both for standalone use and integration within larger DeFi ecosystems.
