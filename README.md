# StratusSwap

creation of a minimal DEX prototype focused on direct ERC20-to-ERC20 token swaps. this repo provides the foundation for a gas-efficient and modular smart contract system that can be progressively expanded into a full-scale DEX.
the goal here is only to train and learn.

## Overview

the initial version of StratusSwap implements a basic token swap mechanism between two ERC20 assets. the smart contracts are optimized for gas usage and written to be modular, allowing for straightforward upgrades such as liquidity pooling, slippage control, and multi-hop routing in later stages.
